# ScrapBook X-BackupHelper - Backup Your ScrapBook

ScrapBookX-BackupHelper is a modified version of the original ScrapBook Add-On Backup Helper, especially for PaleMoon.
This version works with ScrapBookX 
Before you can use this add-on you have to uninstall the original extension ScrapBook BackupHelper or BackupHelper Plus for ScrapBook Plus / XSidebar. Don't enable both extensions BackupHelper and Scrapbook BackupHelper Plus (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scrapbook-backuphelper-bumped-/) at the same time!
